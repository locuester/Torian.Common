Torian Technologies Common Library

This library started nearly 8 years ago during my AnAppADay project (remnants at http://originalanappaday.blogspot.com but I recently forgot to renew the real domain name) and continued as a little utility project that I drag from job to job, and eventually client to client during my years working for myself under the name Torian Technologies.

Much of it is probably defunct since it was started just as .NET 2.0 came out, but I'll be using it as a source of material to blog abaout on my blog here: http://thesoftwarejedi.blogspot.com.  I'll probably also clean it up as I go along (I already did a little).

Cheers!
